In a world of Git, still can't get an answer as to why someone is able to cyber stalk me for close to a year and keep me from working on any computer I touch... I'm under an Advanced Persistence Threat Attack.  iCloud, Drive, CC, OneDrive Hijack... Browser Hijack iOS stalker has remote screen and microphone tapped at my house for fun I guess. I need help.
